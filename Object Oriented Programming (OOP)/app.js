// Object-Oriented JavaScript:

// OOP: Basic idea is that you use objects to represent real world things.
// Objects have own properties and functions (methods). Objects can contain data and other code to represent info
// about what you are trying to model.
// Data/Methods Inside the object is encapsulated.
